While basing a buying decision on nostalgia is somewhat understandable for a bespoke N+1* steel hardtail, to do so on a € 5,000 full-suspension bike is lunacy.At this price point, steel has to deliver serious performance to fight it’s corner against the formidable aluminium and carbon competition. Throwing all the overused steel hyperbole out of the window, we wanted to take an open-minded look at the latest steel bikes on the market. ",
